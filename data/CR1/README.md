This directory contains retrotranposon (CR1) insertion matrix from [Simmons *et al.* (2022)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ympev.2021.107344), where 1 indicates the insertion is present at a given locus and 0 indicates the insertion is absent.

This directory contains data downloaded from [Simmons *et al.* (2022)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ympev.2021.107344).

1. Copied **4345ratites.nex**  `Simmons\ et\ al\ trees\ and\ matrices/retroelements` and then renamed `Gallus` to `galGal` to match the (concatenated) alignments and gene trees. 

Note that this data matrix includes the 4,301 CR1 retrotransposon presence / absence matrix identified by [Cloutier *et al.* (2019)](https://doi.org/10.1093/sysbio/syz019) as well as the 44 identified by [Simmons *et al.* (2022)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ympev.2021.107344).
