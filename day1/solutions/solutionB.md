Activity B Solution
---

**Question B1:** The quartet is `aptRow,rhePen|cryCin,galGal`. The internal branch has length 0.008906 so the probability of this quartet is $1 - 2/3e^{-0.008906} = 0.339$; the alternative quartets have probability $1/3e^{-0.008906} = 0.330$. . 

**Question B2:** This is the same as the question above except sampling `strCam` from group D instead of `galGal`.

**Question B3:** The quartet is `cryCin,tinGut|eudEle,anoDid`. The internal branch has length 2.222865 so the probability of this quartet is $1 - 2/3e^{-2.222865} = 0.928$; the alternative quartets have probability $1/3e^{-2.222865} =  0.036$. 

**Question B4:** The quartet is `notPer,eudEle|tinGut,anoDid`. The internal branch has length 0.569523 so the probability of this quartet is $1 - 2/3e^{-0.569523} = 0.623$; the alternative quartets have probability $1/3e^{-0.569523} = 0.189$. 

**Question B5:** The expected frequencies become closer together as the branch length (in CUs) decreases; in other words, shorter branches result in more ILS. Recall that shorter branches (in CUs) correspond to branches with shorter numbers of generations or larger effective population sizes.
